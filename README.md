# Titanic Survival Prediction and Power BI Dashboard
This project consists of two main components:

1. A Machine Learning Prediction Model to predict passenger survival.
2. A Power BI Dashboard to visualize different aspects of the dataset.

# 1. Prediction Model

## Objective:
The goal of this component is to predict passenger survival using machine learning based on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Steps Taken:
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

📌 Dropping irrelevant columns
📌 Handled missing values.
📌 Outliers handling
📌 Normalization od numerical columns
📌 Converted categorical data into numerical format.
📌 Scaled numerical features for better model performance.
📌 Model Training:

Used the Logistic Regression model to classify passengers as survived (1) or not survived (0).
Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
Prediction Submission:

Generated predictions based on the test dataset.
Submitted results for evaluation.
Files:
📄 Titanic_Predictions.ipynb → Contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.

# 2. Power BI Dashboard
## Objective:
To create a visual representation of Titanic passenger data to understand trends, survival rates, and relationships between key features.

### Steps Taken:
Data Preprocessing (Using Python):

### Cleaned and formatted data specifically for visualization.
📌 Dropped unnecessary columns
📌 Handled missing values and transformed data types.
📌 Feature engineering
📌 Saved the processed dataset for Power BI.
📌 Dashboard Creation (Using Power BI):

Designed interactive charts and graphs to explore survival rates, fares, passenger demographics, and more.
Used bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to present insights clearly.
Files:
📄 Titanic_preprocessed_Data.ipynb → Contains the data cleaning and preprocessing code used for the Power BI dashboard.
🖼️ Titanic_Dashboard.png → Screenshot of the final Power BI dashboard.

# 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

🔸 Python (for data preprocessing and machine learning)
🔸 Power BI → Interactive dashboard for exploratory data analysis

### Dataset Source:
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

This project provides both a predictive model and a visual analysis of Titanic passengers. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute! 🚢
